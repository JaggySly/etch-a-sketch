Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Functionality

Hovering inside the grid will color the tile thats hovered over with the selected color style. The default color is black.

Darken will darken each cell so that it takes exactly 10 almost passes for each individual cell to get to black. Lighten will lighten each cell so that it takes exactly 10 almost passes for each individual cell to get to white.

You can change the amount of tiles in the grid by moving the slider and clicking the apply button to confirm the selection. 

## Thoughts

This project helped solidify how the DOM works and how to manipulate it. It also helped me understand how to modularize my code to make it more readable and clean.
